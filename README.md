# Simple Web3 Units

This packagage includes several classes which extend `ethers.js` with clearer ways to convert between unit types. Not sure which to use for values from smart contract calls? BigNumbers? BigNumberishes? Strings? Numbers? BNs? Simple, just use the `Wei` class. Which has properties to easily convert to any of those types!
